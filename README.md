OpenGL Rotating Cube Sample Application
=======================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the OpenGL implementation in Android to
render a basic rotating cube with textures.

These are the application features:

 * OpenGL shape rendering with textures.
 * Rendering over a transparent background.
 * Multi axis rotation using touch screen.
 * Zoom emulation using touch screen.
 * Friction simulation using settings menu.

Demo requirements
-----------------

To run this example you need:

* One compatible device to host the application.
* A USB connection between the device and the host PC in order to transfer and
  launch the application.

Demo setup
----------

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. The device is powered on.
2. The device is connected directly to the PC by the micro USB cable.

Demo run
--------

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to build and 
launch the project.
  
While it is running, you can control cube rotation in the following ways:

* Sliding your finger on the screen towards the desired cube rotation direction.
* Pitch with your fingers on the screen to change zoom level.
* Press settings button to display friction level selection.
